# Origins

## Phoenix
<details>
<summary>Spoiler</summary>

Heavily inspired by the Adapted Origins Phoenix, I split it into two different origins to fix some of the bugs present with health and added some additional downsides.

### Phoenix True Form Powers

**Positive**
- Rebirth: Revert to your rebirth form upon death.
- Radiant Call: Fully heals every player and mob within a 12 block radius every two minutes. Damages undead.
- Helios Blessing: When under direct sunlight, you receive a speed boost on land and in the air.
- Flight: You have wings.
- Ascent: Launch yourself into the air.
- Fireball: Launch a bouncing fireball which explodes on contact with an enemy. Lights all nearby enemies on fire and knocks them back.
- Taste for Magic: While holding an enchanted book in your offhand, gain food over time. Increased gain while crouching and standing still.
- Glittering: You have a natural affinity for gold. You find more when killing mobs.
- Fire Immunity: You're immune to lava and fire damage.

**Neutral**
- Golden Diet: You can only eat foods infused with gold. They fill you more.
- Fiery Death: Explode into a shower of flames on death, lighting the nearby area on fire.
- Small Body: You're slightly smaller than your average Steve.

**Negative**
- Small Health: You have seven hearts.
- More Kinetic Damage: You take more damage from falling and flying into blocks.
- Water Weakness: Standing in water slows you.
- Water Vulnerability: Standing in water hurts you, as does rain.

### Phoenix Rebirth Form Powers

**Positive**
- Rejuvenation: Be reborn in your True Form after enough time in the sun and/or roosting.
- Roost: While sneaking and not moving, you will gain progress towards Rejuvenating, regardless of there being sunlight or not.
- Gliding: You're just a little chick, you can jump higher and fall like a feather.
- Sunlight: While standing in the sun you gain progress toward Rejuvenating. Standing in Rain or Water will leech this progress.
- Helios Blessing: When under direct sunlight, you receive a speed boost on land and in the air.
- Taste for Magic: While holding an enchanted book in your offhand, gain food over time. Increased gain while crouching and standing still.
- Glittering: You have a natural affinity for gold. You find more when killing mobs.
- Fire Immunity: You're immune to lava and fire damage.

**Neutral**
- Tiny Body: You're only 1 block tall. Quite tiny, really.

**Negative**
- Tiny Health: You have five hearts.
